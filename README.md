# ShoppingList
## Week 2 Assessment at Devmountain
In this assessment, you will build a shopping list application. The shopping list should allow you to create shopping items, as well as check them off if they have been purchased.

### Note the following requirements:
* The initial screen shows a list of shopping items. Each row shows the item title and a checkbox (checked if purchased, unchecked if not).
* There will be an add button that will allow the user to add shopping list  item to the list of shopping items. This can be done by using a text field on the table view controller. It can also be done with an alert controller (black diamond - demonstrated in above video). 
* Tapping on a checkbox will toggle the items purchased state.
* Quitting the app and re-launching it will show your shopping items and their purchased state (persistence).
* Feel free to use any extra time to challenge yourself with the black diamonds and make your app look good.

### Black Diamonds
* Use an alert controller to prompt the user for a shopping item.
* Implement sectioning to show purchased and non-purchased items in separate sections.
* Add a detail view which allows the quantity of an item to be changed, as well as an item's purchased state.

### Covered Concepts
